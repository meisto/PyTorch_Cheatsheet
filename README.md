WIP!

## 1. About this document.
This is a personal cheatsheet I use when I forget some commands. Feel free to use it as you like.

## 2. Library

```python
# Define a loss function
loss_mae = torch.nn.L1Loss  # Mean absolute error
loss_mse = torch.nn.MSELoss # Mean squared error
torch.nn.NLLLoss # Negative log likelihood loss
torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss # Cross-Entropy loss
torch.nn.KLDivLoss # Kullback-Leibler divergence
```
